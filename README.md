# The PKM Toolbox
This is a tool box for developing a Personal Knowledge Management System (PKMS). These files are formatted in github-flavored markdown for the best interoperability I can offer. I am tool agnostic when it comes to PKMSs; any PKM tool that reads/displays markdown.  

## Navigating the files
- **LLMPromts:** Prompts that can be used with LLM such as ChatGPT, Claude, etc.
- **obsidianTemplates:**= file templates that have YAML front-matter that creates a document type within Obsidian. However, the content material is usable in other PKMS.
